---
# conversation /src/AppControl.js
## Imported Code Object
 The `dispatch(updateConversation({ convoIndex, conversation: data }))` line is used to update the conversation state in the `AppControl.js` file. The `updateConversation` action is passed an object with two properties: `convoIndex` and `conversation`. The `convoIndex` property is the index of the conversation in the state, and the `conversation` property is the new conversation data. The `updateConversation` action then updates the conversation state in the store.

---
# convoIndex /src/AppControl.js
## Imported Code Object
 The convoIndex variable is used to store the index of the conversation that matches the data.participants array. The findIndex() method is used to find the index of the first element in the conversations.messages array that matches the data.participants array. The equalArrays() function is used to compare the two arrays and return true if they are equal. If a match is found, the index of the conversation is stored in the convoIndex variable. Otherwise, -1 is stored in the convoIndex variable.

---
# conversations.messages.findIndex() callback /src/AppControl.js
## Imported Code Object
 The conversations.messages.findIndex() callback in the code snippet you provided is used to find the index of the conversation that has the same participants as the data.participants array. The findIndex() method takes a callback function as its argument, and the callback function is called for each element in the array until it returns a true value. In this case, the callback function returns true if the data.participants array and the conversation.participants array are equal. If the callback function returns true, the findIndex() method returns the index of the element that the callback function was called on. Otherwise, the findIndex() method returns -1.
